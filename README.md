# My_portfolio
A responsive portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript showcases an individual's skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing manner. The design adapts seamlessly across various devices, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</br>
# HTML
Using HTML, the structure of the portfolio is created, allowing for easy organization of content such as project descriptions, images, and contact information.

# CSS
CSS enhances the visual aesthetics, providing styling elements like fonts, colors, and layouts that reflect the individual's personal brand. Flexbox and CSS Grid techniques are employed to ensure a fluid layout that adjusts based on screen size.</br>

# Javascript
JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling features such as smooth scrolling, image galleries, and animations that engage visitors. This portfolio not only serves as a digital resume but also demonstrates technical proficiency in web development. Overall, this project emphasizes the importance of responsive design in today's mobile-centric world, making a strong impression on potential employers or clients.</br>
